   TO DAVIDIANS EVERYWHERE
------------------------

###  Our message teaches that Truth is ever progress with It. The Servant of the Lord encourages us with these words :

"In reviewing our past history, having traveled over every step of advance to our present standing, I can say, Praise God! As I see what God has wrought, I am filled with astonishment, and with confidence in Christ as leader. We have nothing to fear for the future, except as we shall forget the way the Lord has led us." _Testimonies to Ministers, p. 31._

With the thought in mind that we have nothing to fear for the future, we can take courage and press onward regardless what comes. Even as the children of Israel did not know what they would have to encounter and meet from day to day in their experience, so we do not know what our day by day experiences may bring forth. Still we know that God is our sure Guide and support in every time of need.

And now· it is with natural sorrow in our hearts we announce the sad news that after several years of failing health, **Brother Houteff passed away Sabbath at 12:05 A.M., February 5, at the Hillcrest Hospital in Waco**.

 -- {sc 3}   
  
  In His Providence the Lord permitted Brother Houteff to rest from his suffering. We know that it was God's will and so we would not want it different. The promise, "And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose" (Rom. 8:28), is very dear to us especially at this time, and we are trusting in the Lord to work everything out according to His planning. We are continuing with the work that has been appointed to each of us, and we are confident that God will be with us as He has in the past.

When the children of Israel went through a similar experience, the Lord assured them that " ... I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. Be strong and of a good courage ... " Josh. 1:5,6. May we all take hold of these promises and continue in the Truth that God has brought to us in this crucial hour of the world's history, and be among those who shall inherit the Kingdom prepared for us from the foundation of the world.

 From the Spirit of Prophecy we find the following admonition also fitting to us as a people at this time:

 "The divine command was, 'Go forward!' They were not to wait until the way was made plain, and they could comprehend the entire plan of their deliverance God's cause is onward, and he will open a path before his people...

 -- {sc 4}   
  
  “The voice of the Lord bidding his faith¬ful ones ‘go forward,’ frequently tries their faith to the uttermost. But if they should defer obedience till every shadow of uncertainty was removed from their understanding, and there remained no risk of failure or defeat, they would never move on at all. Those who think it impossible for them to yield to the will of God and have faith in his promises until all is made clear and plain before them, will never yield at all. Faith is not certainty of knowl¬edge; it ‘is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.’..."—_Testi¬monies. Volume 4, pages 25-28._

Our work has been clearly set before us. It is important that in a concerted and an undiminished effort we set about our Father’s business of bearing the Message of not only good tidings but also of warning to the impenitent, especially when their eternal life is at stake.

 Already, a practical heart-lifting “go for¬ward” move, underwritten by the Lord and begun by Brother Houteff continues in op¬eration. This we know as the “hunting” program (Jer. 16:16) and as it goes forward even now, we are impressed with this statement which you will recognize as coming from Jezreel Letter No. 6: ‘This, you note, is not Brother Houteff but the Layman’s Movement, imbued with the Spirit, and at work.”

 All this is focusing a new and greater significance to the Lord ordained Laymen’s Movement brought to our attention in recent months. Thus, under the Lord’s guiding Hand, this work will advance from

 -- {sc 5}   
  
  victory to victory in a final movement that will in the Lord’s righteousness cut the work short.

 What a challenge! What a hope! It is our prayer that not a single Davidian will fall back into the fatal pit of Laodiceanism at such a solemn hour as this. On the con¬trary, it is imperative that each of us take new hope in the fact that we can have a part in this ever so glorious final victory in Jesus and His Truth. Let us then remain steadfast and faithful to our belief, never wavering, never doubting, but pressing on to a home in God’s soon coming Kingdom.

 In conclusion, I wish to welcome your continued correspondence in which you may feel free to make known your needs and problems, your joys and sorrows, and we shall do our best with the Lord’s help to serve your interests.

 Above all, keep us in your prayers that we may ever be wise and faithful stewards over the Lord’s goods.

 Sincerely yours ever to lean wholly on the Lord at all times,

(Mrs.) V.T. Houteff

  REPOSE
------

’Tis Sabbath morn; the daylight comes,

To find Mt. Carmel weeping.

The shrubs and trees with leaves bowed down For one who

now is sleeping.

Grant him a time of light repose, A moment’s sleep he’s taking.

The raindrops fall in promise sure Of harvest at his waking.

Weep not for him—his life is sealed, ’Tis God Who holds-him fast.

A little rest--then work begins,

The scope is wide and vast.

Let those who love him carry on The purpose full in view, The cause for which he gave himself,

Our charge—to see it through.

To those he loved—a faith bequeathed, As strong as iron bands,

Enabling by the grace of God To view the labor of his hands.

Due to the fact that the Chapel was inadequate to accommodate the many brethren and friends who came for the services from the various states, the funeral service was held in the spacious newly constructed publishing building. The interior of the building was simply but beautifully arranged for the occasion.

 -- {sc 8}   
  
  Victor Tasho Houteff was born in Raicovo, Bulgaria, March 2, 1885, and died February 5, 1955, at the Hillcrest Hospital in Waco, Texas. He is survived by his widow, Flo¬rence Houteff; three brothers, Nick Houteff of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Leo and Theodore Houteff of Bulgaria; three sisters, Mrs. Marie Starbovo, Mrs. Anna Demeter and Mrs. Fimea Gavrealoff all of Bulgaria.

 Brother Houteff’s first religious affilia¬tion was with the Greek Orthodox church. In 1907 he came to the United States. Several years later, while in the hotel business at Rockford Illinois, he accepted the Seventh-day Adventist faith and was baptized. Soon thereafter he moved to Los Angeles, California, where he was successfully en¬gaged in sales work; he was recognized by all his associates as one who practiced his religion in the conduct of his business.

 A faithful churchgoer, he took active part in the many church endeavors and was gen¬erous in his support of the work. In his capacity Of Sabbath School teacher in the years 1928 and 1929 he proved both gifted and inspired in his presentation of the lessons—so much so that church member after church member crowded into his, class, until finally it became necessary for him to hold special sessions in a private home.

 As a result, in 1930 Brother Houteff wrote The Shepherd’s Rod. Vol. 1, the first in a series of doctrinal publication of which he is the author.

 -- {sc 9}   
  
  In the year 1934 he established the Universal Publishing Association, also the General Offices of what is now known as the GENERAL ASSOCIATION OF DAVIDIAN

SEV¬ENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS. His next book was entitled The Shepherd’s Rod. Vol. 2, followed through the years by 24 booklets, a periodical called The Symbolic Code, and the Timely Greetings consisting of 98 pamphlets.

 In 1935 Brother Houteff brought the world¬wide headquarters of the Association, together with the Universal Publishing Association, to Mt. Carmel Center, Waco, Texas. It was here that two years later on January 1, 1937, he was united in marriage to Miss Florence Marcello Hermanson, who has stood faithfully by her husband’s side in sickness and in health, and has shared the heavy burdens of his work.

 Among the many projects inaugurated under Brother Houteff’s able leadership are Mt. Carmel Center with its various department, including the Rest Home, the Dispensary, the International Mercantile Association, the Davidic-Levitical Institute, and the Lake Shore Subdivision; and the glorious Kingdom flag.

 Serving through the years in capacities too numerous to list, giving his all to the work of the Lord, Brother Houteff in life took no rest from his tireless efforts to fulfil his great calling. And now the Lord has seen fit to let our beloved Brother, after several years of failing health rest for a little while. “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His <span style="text-decoration: underline;">saints.”— Ps. 116:15.</span>

  ##### FUNERAL SERMON

**for**

 **BROTHER HOUTEFF**

As we continue with this memorial service, in honor and respect for him who gave a full measure of devotion to the Lord’s cause for His church here on earth, and is now momentarily taking his sleep, I shall read from the writings of the sweet singer of Israel.

 “The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name’s sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.”—Psalm 23.

 These words are an eternal expression of the Lord’s servant’s hope. David, the king of Israel, likening himself to a sheep with the Lord as his Shepherd, was able to look beyond the mysteries of this mortal life with its uncertainties into the future, and with unmistakable clearness was able to say, “yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.” Why?

 -- {sc 11}   
  
  Because the Lord was his Shepherd; and the Shepherd’s Rod and His staff, they comforted him. And he had the assurance and was well able to declare that he would dwell in the house of the Lord, his Shepherd, forever.

 If the David of old, with all of his trials, temptations, besetments, and defeats, was able by faith in God’s Word alone to look into the future and declare such an abiding hope, I am sure that the one who is taking his short rest had that same hope. True, indeed, Brother Houteff has fought a good fight; he has kept the faith.

 Honest hearts the world around have rejoiced at his teachings. These have been in their mouths as sweet as honey, sweet upon their lips with a promise of no bitterness and no disappointment. These honest souls have been rejoicing in the Truth even as the wheat, which, while it is in the field, rejoices in the latter rain that the Lord sends to ripen and prepare it for the final harvest and is finally placed in the Master’s barn. But while many are rejoicing throughout the length and breadth of the land, there are also those who have been trembling because of the firm denun¬ciation of their sins and the defilement which they have brought into the house of God. Even as in ancient times, when ancient Israel under King Ahab trembled at the words of Elijah from ancient Mt. Carmel, so has modern Israel trembled today, and are still trembling.

 There is no grave so deep nor tomb so strong as to be able to silence the “Voice” that crieth

 -- {sc 12}   
  
  unto the “city,“ and erelong the shout of victory shall sound from one end of the earth to the other and through all the cities of Israel: “0 death, where is thy sting? 0 grave, where is thy victory?” 1 Cor. 15:55.

 Today, Carmel and its large family mourn. We mourn the loss of a husband, a brother, a fellow-worker, and a kingly leader; but we do not mourn as others, because we see that God, Who holds the earth in the palm of His Hands, is merely working out His own will in His Own good way.

 Out of the fires of sickness and suffering, the Lord is to bring forth health and purity, a robe of righteousness, and a golden crown which shall soon be placed upon the head.

 Those who have been associated with Brother Houteff have learned that he worked by faith, even as the Lord’s servants of yesterday worked, and which we find recorded in Hebrews the eleventh chapter.

 “By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith. By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was

 -- {sc 13}   
  
  a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment. By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing Him Who is invisible. By faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned. By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days. And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.” Heb. 11:7,8, 23, 27, 29, 30,39, 40.

 Therefore we are engaged in a work which in its beginning had nothing in a material sense to start with. It was started through faith in God’s Word. It was established by hope and prospered through the exercise of charity. And so it is that by faith we must continue on until the work is completed. There is no stopping. We also know that Brother Houteff’s constant aim and purpose were to get his work done. He was still laboring and planning his work, when he was taken to his short rest. We are confident that his hope is also expressed in the words of an¬other who took her rest while she was en¬gaged in the Lord’s work. Before she passed away she expressed her hope in these words which you will recognize come from _Testimonies for the Church. Vol. 7, p. 17:_

 “...Your work, my work, will not cease with this life. For a little while we may rest in the grave, but, when the call comes, we shall, in the kingdom of God, take up our work once-more.”

 -- {sc 14}   
  
  The author of this statement, while living, had the hope that although her work of turning sinners to righteousness might cease temporarily while she rested in the grave for a short time, yet the day was coming when she would be brought forth from that grave and take up her work once more in the Kingdom of God. That such a time is coming when sleeping saints shall arise and turn sinners to righteousness is clearly set forth in the Scriptures, recorded in the twelfth chapter of Daniel, verses 2, 3.

 “And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.”

 Here Inspiration foretells that a day is coming when a resurrection will take place and those who turn many to righteousness shall shine as the stars forever and ever. Since it was the hope of both of these of whom I have spoken that they would come forth and take up their work once more, it must be that while mercy patiently lingers the Lord is going to call forth from the grave His sleeping saints, the faithful ones, and they shall go forth and turn many to righteousness. That is how they take up their work once more. They had a work once, they laid it aside temporarily, and now they take it up once more. Not a new work, but an old work laid aside and then taken up again. This is one of the Truths which Brother Houteff has sponsored, which he has taught, and has helped to make Davidian

 -- {sc 15}   
  
  Seventh-day Adventists.

 If there are any who are to profit from the service of today, it is we, those who are still living, those of us who still have a span of life ahead of us, whether it be long or short.

 And to those who have come here in honor and respect for him who is now resting, whatever your belief may be, I would say, “Live your religion, be a producer for others not merely a consumer for yourself; for in Christendom today there are too many who are merely consumers for themselves.” This, too, was Brother Houteff’s teaching and his practice, that he should produce more for others than he consumed upon himself. And for those of us who remain, and have united in this “closing work for the church” I shall read the verses containing the last commission given us by our leader. It is recorded in Jeremiah 16:14-16. In the 14th verse Inspi¬ration is speaking, referring to the Lord as the Lord Who at one time had brought Is-rael up out of the land of Egypt.

 “Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that it shall no more be said, The Lord liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.” Jer. 16:14.

 Anciently it was the custom of the people to say The Lord now lives Who brought the children of Israel up out of the land of Egypt, but the day is coming when that shall no more be said. “But, The Lord liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north

 -- {sc 16}   
  
  and from all the lands whither He had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers.” This is something that never has yet been done.

 “Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the Lord, and they shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.” Jer.16:16.

 That is the commission that the Lord’s servant has given us. We are told the Lord commissions His people to go and hunt Israel from every mountain, from every hill and even out of the holes of the rocks, and in the Lord’s strength this we do.

 God has given us a work to do and the one whom He appointed to lead us in this task has set the example for each one of us to follow. Brother Houteff, our leader, was not a quitter; he did not permit himself to be overcome by discouragement. Neither did he give himself over to feelings. If he were to speak to us Davidians upon this occasion, today, I am sure he would tell us, “On with the work. Stop nothing short of victory.” He would admonish us “do not repeat the same mistakes of Israel in the past, or that of modern Israel, by stopping where their leaders went to rest. Keep on going; do not stop just because I am resting. Keep on going; look to the Lord, the Author and Finisher of your faith.”

 Now is the time for each one of us Davidians, as a people, believing in progressive Truth, to show

 -- {sc 17}   
  
  our respect for our leader and belief in his message by laying aside all of our selfish wants, and uniting in a concerted effort to carry on the cause to a glorious victory which shall soon come to pass. Doubt and unbelief, should not be known in our ranks, but as the Apostle Paul, we should, say “forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus" (Phil. 3:13, 14)— the establishment of the everlasting Kingdom.

 Our report today should be the same as was that of Joshua and Caleb”We are well able to go up and take the land.”

 Just as soldiers in the heat of battle look to the symbol of their nation, take courage, pledge themselves anew, and then leap forward into the task that is at hand, so today every Davidian on Carmel and throughout the length and breadth of the land should, look up to the symbol of our work and with a thrill in our voices we in our hearts should say “we pledge our hearts, our minds, our hands, our all, to the flag of God’s eternal Kingdom, and to the Theocracy for which it stands, one people made up of all nations, and bound by the cords of everlasting love, liberty, purity, justice, peace, happiness, light and life for all.” We should have a joyful chorus upon our lips such as this, “Forward, forward, ’tis the Lord’s command; forward, forward, to the Promised land; forward forward, let the chorus ring; we are sure to win with Christ our King.” I am sure this thought in our hearts is the greatest respect which we

 -- {sc 18}   
  
  can pay to the one whom the Lord has chosen to lead His people thus far, and that ere long, we will see fulfilled, “Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.”

 “This lnd that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and are inhabited....I the Lord build the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate: I the Lord have spoken it, and I will do it.” “For, great shall be the day of Jezreel.” Hos. 1:4; Ezek. 36:24, 28, 35, 36; Hos. 1:11

  APPRECIATION
------------

Words are utterly inadequate to convey my deep appreciation for each of the many messages by telephone, telegraph, and nail, as well as the lovely floral pieces sent by you dear brethren at the passing of my husband. And I sincerely regret that because there are so many, I cannot personally acknowledge individually your expressions of faith, hope, and sympathy.

 However, I do want each of you to know that your messages of condolence were a great personal comfort in the days just past and will be dearly cherished in the days ahead as we go forward in the Lord’s strength performing the tasks that have been clearly outlined for us.

  EXECUTIVE OFFICERS APPOINTED
----------------------------

In the very nature of the Divine set-up of the General Association of Davidian Seventh-day Adventists (Constitution and By-Laws of Davidian Seventh-day Adventists, p. 6, par. 1), the office of president for the time being remains vacant.

 In harmony with recommendations made by Brother Houteff before his death the Executive Council, in accordance with the Constitution and By-Laws of the General Association of Davidian Seventh-day Adventists, met and unanimously passed and adopted the following resolutions:

 That Mrs. Florence Houteff be appointed and elected to the office of Vice-President of the General Association of Davidian Seventh-day Adventists;

 And that T.0. Hermanson be appointed and elected a member of the Executive Council.

 Also lected to office was J. 0. Conrad to succeed Mrs. Florence Houteff in the ca¬pacity of Executive Secretary.

 Members of the Executive Council include: Mrs. Florence Houteff, Vice President of the Association; J. 0. Conrad, Executive Secre¬tary; Mrs. S. Hermanson, Treasurer; M.

1. Wolfe; C. W. Helman; A. Quackenbush; G. W. Saether;
2. 0. Hermanson.
 
 -- {sc 21}   
  
  And now as we take another step forward with advancing Truth, doing all things “decently and in order,” let nothing stop us short of our object—bringing about that reformation among God’s people which is prerequisite to the sounding of the “Eleventh-Hour Call,” the Loud Cry, through which shall be gathered all the saints into the Kingdom “which shall never be destroyed...but...shall break in pieces and consume all... kingdoms.” Dan. 2:44.

 -- {sc 22}   
  
  UNITY AMONG BELIEVERS
---------------------

Far and wide there is much talk about unity in and among civic organizations, churches, states, and nations. Even the lofty ideals of one world and of one church challenge the modern mind. And though this ardent preoccupation with unity is one of the most noble and most powerful among men, yet unless it is Christ-centered, it is of the subtlest of delusions, the sheerest of vanities. The redemp¬tive unity of brotherhood in Christ is the supreme need of both the church and the world, and is the supreme good which Inspiration exalts as in the 133 Psalm:--

 "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments; as the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore."

 Thus being infinitely "good” and "pleasant" to the soul now and requisite to "life for evermore," this vital unity will therefore be of paramount concern to every true Davidian Seventh-day Adventist. Indeed, it will be his ever-pressing ideal and goal.

 The measure of unity we achieve will not be!the result of chance but will come as we conscientiously comply with the progressive requirements, admonitions, and instructions which the

 -- {sc 23}   
  
  Lord gives us. Necessarily, then, we must ever be closely aware of just what God's message for today teaches. How essential therefore that we study and assimilate it till it becomes the controlling part of us. Ezekiel was told to eat the book (Ezekiel 2:9, 10; 3:3). We must do the same. Thus only can unity be attained.

 Then, "thy watchmen shall lift up the voice [the Message]; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion."--Isa. 52:8.

 Those who do not eat the book and sing together engender variance, strife, and confusion in our ranks. Thus the imperative need that we know what we teach and teach only what we know; and that we comply with exactly what the Message teaches and requires; and that we keep ourselves free from uninspired writings. Only such efforts will God bless.

 Furthermore, would we have the saving unity for which Christ prayed, we must guard our lips and hold our tongues from gossip and evil speaking about our brethren, for it is Satan's studied purpose thus to confuse and disunite the ranks of Christ.

 Beloved, it is not opposition from the Lao- diceans that is our greatest danger. Rather it is envy, jealousy, suspicion, pride, evil imagin¬ings and surmisings that could come in among ourselves. It is these that retard the work and weaken courage. So give no ear to it. Ask:

 -- {sc 24}   
  
  "Who art thou that judgest another man's ser¬vant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand."--Rom. 14:4. "Judge not, that ye be not judged.''--Matt. 7:1.

 As brethren in the faith, members of one family, with the same Kingdom hope, let us now press together, striving, praying, and working for love and unity among us. With everyone at his God-given post of duty and attending strictly to his own business, we can be more than conquerors through Him that loved us, and gave Himself for us.

 EVANGELISTIC SERIES HELD AT MOUNT CARMEL
-----------------------------------------

A series of eleven evangelistic meetings held in Mount Carmel chapel beginning Fri¬day evening, December 24, and closing Sab¬bath afternoon, January 1, featured the theme "The Kingdom of God is at Hand."

 The meetings were arranged by all the Hunt¬ers on leave from the field and this series proved, through the Lord's guidance, to be one of the most heart-stirring and solemn series ever held at Mount Carmel. Both young and old were moved by the emphasis placed on the nearness of God's Kingdom and our need to be fully prepared and ready for the events soon to come upon us.

 -- {sc 25}   
  
  Attendance at each meeting was good with visitors swelling the ranks, and at one gathering there was an overflow crowd. The meet¬ings, although not humanly planned that way, turned out to be eleven in number, one short of the symbol of government, number twelve. It was pointed out that this may be indicative of how close we are to the Kingdom.

 Emphasis throughout the meetings was placed on the shortness of time, the need for placing all on the altar of sacrifice, pressing closer together in unity and love, and going for¬ward in faith to full victory in Christ. A few brief experiences from the field were given by some of the Hunters disclosing the progress of the work under God and how the Message is steadily moving forward in spite of continued opposition.

 Those who brought messages during the series of meetings included: Fred Campbell, Roy Crearer, Ray Custer, Dudley Goff, Wayne Goff, Cecil Helman, T. 0. Hermanson, John P. Kelley, Jack Knipple, Sr. Stoy Proctor, 0. 0. Richardson, H. C.Sealy, Harmon Springer, Vanoy V. Smith, E. T. Wilson, Merritt Wolfe, Fayne Worth, Vaughn Worth, and Fannie Lou Woods.

 One meeting was devoted exclusively to Mount Carmel children participation. Sister Vanoy Smith and Sister Claudie Mae Woods supervised this meeting with the aid of visual illustrations. These pictorial lessons operated by the children showed the broad way to destruction, the side roads to be avoided, and the narrow road to the Kingdom

  TODAY'S CHALLLENGE
------------------

On the Sabbath preceding the orientation of this fall's ministerial class, a sermon was given by Brother Oliver Hermanson in which he reviewed the pioneering work of the Message and of Mount Carmel Center.

 The struggles and sacrifices to get the Message launched in Laodicea and to build Mt. Carmel were chronologically recalled. Along with this was recounted the Seventh-day Adventist ministry's fierce opposition in its unsuccessful efforts to suppress and squelch the God- sent Message while It was in Its infancy. He told us how the Davidians were barred from the Seventh-day Adventist churches, and how in some instances they were even bodily carried out. These attacks were not uncommon in those early days.

 After the unfair hearing by the Conference committee of twelve men in 1934, a trip was made to Texas in search of a central location for the headquarters from which to carry for¬ward the work. The three location hunters, he said, were led to Waco's lake-shore hills where the Center now stands-- this being the highest point in the county, Waco’s best scenic site, the very things that make these hills a most desirable and distinctive residential spot. The twelve Mount Carmel pioneers arrived from California on the 24th of May, 1934, in the midst of the depression and started to build this center solely by faith.

  There was nothing on the place but timber and brush. The

axe was the first tool to go into use. Construction first began on a simple flat roof frame building to house the Institution’s and the pioneers, belongings that were to be brought by trucks a few days after the group of twelve arrived. The builders at first slept and cooked in the open under the trees.

 Black gumbo muddy roads to walk and drive over, water to be had only by hauling a distance of six miles in barrels the first two years, and later in a 300-gallon tank, kerosene lamps for light, poor housing and homemade wood stoves were a few of the obstacles that faced the pioneers.

 In spite of the handicaps all along the way the establishment of the Center made steady progress. So while hundreds of businesses were going bankrupt, Mt. Camel grew and prospered. The first ministerial class, active Hunters now in the field, met for study only after a full day's work.

 A point which Brother Hermanson emphasized was that in those days the building up of Mount Carmel and the postage stamp by which to carry the Message to Laodicea were of prime importance. Now, however, he pointed out that the greatest need is for Hunters in the field for truly the harvest of the first fruits is great and increasingly ripe.

 An appeal was made to the new students to fully consecrate and dedicate themselves to the Lord

  and His Eleventh-hour Call. He explained that not everything would be pleasant and easy when they enter the field work, but that the joy over one true convert far over-shadows the abuse and opposition encountered from the deceived class of Laodicean brethren.

 From Testimonies to Ministers, page 107, he read: "No one should claim that he has all the light there is for God's people. The Lord will not tolerate this. He has said, 'I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it.' Even if all our leading men should refuse light and truth, that door will still remain open. The Lord will raise up men who will give the people message for this time." (Emphasis Ours)

 This passage was cited as encouragement for each new ministerial student to the end that they can be among the men raised up by the Lord if they will but let His will be done in their lives.

 Brother Hermanson closed by reading _Gospel Workers, pages 65, 66:_ "The number of workers in the ministry is not to be lessened, but greatly increased. Where there is now one minister in the field, twenty are to be added; and if the Spirit of God controls them, these twenty will so present the Truth that twenty more will be added."

 This multiplication of workers, he explained, has already begun to be literally fulfilled in the Davidian ministerial increase, and is becoming a still greater reality with each passing day.

  **AWAKE, ARISE, SHINE**
-----------------------

What is now taking place speaks loud enough to awake any slumberer if he can possibly be awakened. Coming events will be even more rapid It therefore behooves us immediately, with the Lord's help, to re-examine ourselves, individually and collectively, to see if we are awake, and have our ears open to the trend of the times, and our hearts possessed by the Word of God; if, in short, we are working to bring the Kingdom of God "in the days of these kings."--Dan. 2:44.

 With such an unremitting resposibility upon us, God help us not to fall back into Laodicean- ism, but to heed to the full Inspiration's long- suffering voice: —

 "My brethren and sisters, do you desire to break the spell that holds you? Would you arouse from this sluggishness that resembles the torpor of death? Go to work, whether you feel like it or not. Engage in personal effort to bring souls to Jesus and the knowledge of the truth. In such labor you will find both a stimulus and a tonic; it will both arouse and strengthen. By exercise your spiritual powers will become more vigorous, so that you can, with better success, work out your own salvation. The stupor of death is upon many who profess Christ. Make every effort to arouse them. Warn, entreat, expostulate. Pray that the melting love of God may warm and soften their ice-

  bound natures. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Though they may refuse to hear, vour labor will not be lost. In the effort to bless others, vour own souls will be blessed.</span>

 "We have the theory of the truth, and now we need to seek most earnestly for its sanctifying power. I dare not hold my peace in this time of peril. It is a time of temptation, of despondency. Every one is beset by the wiles of Satan, and we should press to¬gether to resist his power. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">We should be of one mind, sneaking the same things, and with one mouth glorifying God. </span>Then may we successfully enlarge our plans, and by vigilant missionary effort, take advantage of every talent we can use in the various departments of the work."--_Testimonies. Vol. 5, pp. 387- 388._ (Emphasis ours.)

 The hour is too late to devote the strength of brain and muscle and our material benefits to self-serving. The day is fast approaching when it will be said: "Give an account of thy stewardship."

 Davidians, awake, arise, shine by absorbing all the God- sent oil for your lamps. Only then will you hear Him say: "Well done thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." Matt. 25:21.
