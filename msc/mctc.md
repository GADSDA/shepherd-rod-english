  ### **LIFE’S OBJECT**

 “ **‘Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.’ 1 Cor. 2:9.**

 “To dwell forever in this home of the blest, to bear in soul, body and spirit, not the dark traces of sin and the curse, but the perfect likeness of our Creator, and through ceaseless ages to advance in wisdom, in knowledge, and in holiness, ever exploring new fields of thought, ever finding new wonders and new glories, ever increasing in capacity to know and to enjoy and to love, and knowing that there is still beyond us joy and love and wisdom infinite, – such is the object to which the Christian’s hope is pointing, for which Christian’s education is preparing. To secure this education, and to aid others to secure it, should be the object of the Christian’s life.” – _Counsels to Teachers_, p. 55.

  Mt. Carmel Training Center
--------------------------

 [PICTURE]

### Location

 Mt. Carmel Training Center was established in 1935, and is located six miles northwest of Waco, Texas. Its 375 acres a sylvan sanctuary, and its western and northern prominences commanding unexcelled views of beautiful Lake Waco some three hundred feet below, and the picturesque vistas beyond, it is happy indeed for situation solitarily in the woods.

### Purpose

 In such propitious setting, it was raised up at this late hour (the “eleventh” – Matt. 20:6) in the history of the gospel, as proving grounds for that Christian army (Joel 2:2-11; Mic. 5:7, 8) which is to restore the soon-coming and everlasting Kingdom. Hence, upon all who come within the compass of its influence its fundamental injunction is that prime principle enunciated by the greatest Teacher the world has ever known: “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness.” Matt. 6:33.

 -- {mctc 5}   
  
   Thus it is called forth to implement the divine task of gathering, educating, and disciplining men and women for a place in the long-hoped-for Kingdom and, consequently, for the joy of a glorious service now in the “harvest” at the end of this world, and the subsequent higher joy of an ever more glorious service in the world to come.

 Its educational processes therefore having to do with the whole man for time and for eternity, Mt. Carmel’s constant aim is to educate hand, mind, and heart in a harmonious development of the physical, the mental, and the spiritual powers. By this threefold education it seeks to restore in man the image of his Maker – to promote the development of body, mind, and soul, that the immortal perfection divinely purposed in his creation might be realized.

### Mould

 As prerequisite to its accomplishing this divine task, the school has from its inception been cast in the divine mould of the ancient schools of the prophets. Struck from this divine pattern, its entire educational structure has for its foundation the Word of God; and for its study, the grand object of all study: to learn the will of God, the sole knowledge that fits for citizenship in the “kingdom prepared...from the foundation of the world.” Matt. 25:34.

 -- {mctc 6}   
  
  ### Atmosphere

 Possessed of this heritage of divine purpose and mould, the institution is invested with an atmosphere of supreme purposiveness. Teacher and student breathing deeply of this inspiration are impelled to supreme effort to achieve to the supreme heights where, among the elect, at the feet of the Teacher of teachers, in the Classroom of classrooms, he shall learn the Science of sciences – the Key of knowledge which shall unlock unto him the Kingdom of God.

### Persons Accepted

 Consistent with this divine design, Mt. Carmel matriculates only such persons as are known to subscribe in full to its beliefs, its purposes, and its principles, and who aspire to a place in the final work of the gospel – the restoration of every divine institution, and the ushering in of enduring peace on earth and good will toward men.

 Right is reserved to refuse admission to anyone who appears for entrance without having previously filled out and returned an application form provided by the college, and without having received notification of acceptance.

School Plant

 In keeping with its belief in both the imminent end of all things mundane, and the principles of simplicity and modesty, the institution is building unpretentiously.

 -- {mctc 7}   
  
  Its plant to date is composed of six main structures and a number of subsidiary ones. All save one (which is of tile) are of frame and stone construction. These at present provide an administration center, a chapel, classrooms, dormitories and other living quarters, kitchen, dining room, laundry, dispensary, nursery, material and storage shed, pump-house, water storage tank, water-works control house, and produce depot.

### Ministerial Correspondence Course

 Students who prior to their coming here have done satisfactory work in the school’s correspondence course are allowed ministerial credit.

### Pre-Ministerial Course

 As an integral part of its structure, its educational system provides cumulative pre-ministerial preparation in a sustained twelve-grade course, embracing the fundamental branches of learning, for students of elementary, intermediate, and secondary school age.

### Attendance

1. Punctual and regular attendance at all classes, special meetings, and religious services is required of students.

 “Of all the features of an education to be given...the religious exercises are the most important.” – _Testimonies_, Vol. 6, p. 174.

 -- {mctc 8}   
  
  1. Absence and tardy lists will be posted once a week.
2. _Only_ such absences, other than for illness, as have been arranged for by the institution are excusable.
3. Reasons for an absence or tardiness must be filed within twenty-four hours of the return of the student to his classes.
4. A student having in any one class absences amounting to more than 15 percent of the total sessions of that class will receive an “F” in that subject.
5. A second unexcused absence in a year whether in the same or another class, carries a fine of 50¢. (Additional unexcused absences become a matter of more drastic discipline.)
6. Two unexcused tardinesses are equal to one unexcused absence.
7. A leave of absence does not excuse from classes. Reason for absence from each class must be submitted.
8. Any student withdrawing from a class in any other than the proper manner, or dropping out because of unsatisfactory work, will receive an “F” in that subject.

### Deportment

 A student whose conduct, spirit, or influence is out of harmony with the standards and principles of the institution, may be dismissed at any time even through he may not have violated any specific regulations.

 -- {mctc 9}   
  
   “One student with careless ideas may do more to let down the standard, than ten men with all their effort can do to counteract the demoralizing influence.

 “Failure or success will be read in the course the students pursue. If they stand ready to question rules and regulations and order, if they indulge self, and by their example encourage a spirit of rebellion, give them no place. The institution might better close its doors than suffer this spirit to leaven the helpers and break down the barriers that it has cost thought, effort, and prayer to establish.” – _Counsels to Teachers_, p. 482.

Ministerial Curriculum
----------------------

### Vocational

 The manual phase of the student’s training. It is gained through daily pursuit of one or more of the institution’s various employments. Both in theory and in practice, right methods and procedures are constantly inculcated for right results. Efficiency is stressed as the result of energetic application and concentration, carefulness, thoroughness, speed, and proficiency. The irrepressible desire for some greater good, the indomitable will to success, the strenuous exertion, the untiring perseverance are cultivated as the elements of character which make a man successful and honored among men, and which will win for him the highest of all promotions and commendations,

 -- {mctc 10}   
  
  “_Well done_, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.” Matt. 25:21. Work is thus dignified and restored to its original primacy in the redemptive processes.

 Therefore the basic and most potent factor of discipline and growth in the student’s training experience (as well as the means of his livelihood), it is accordingly exploited as the most productive source and means of symmetrical character development.

### _Spirit of Prophecy_

 A perspective study of the prophetic gift, its vital place and purpose in the church, past, present, and future. Special attention is directed to its climactic manifestation, work, and fruits.

### _Prophetic Eschatology_

 An intensive study of end-conditions and end-events as revealed in correlative and convergent lines of prophetic testimony, parable, ceremony, and number. Predominant emphasis is upon their pragmatic integration in the believer’s credenda.

### _Revealed Philosophy_

 A strictly non-speculative inquiry into the divine scheme of things, into the Absolute and Its unities. Approach is made objectively in the light of revealed knowledge. The aim is progressive elevation and

 -- {mctc 11}   
  
  enlargement of the soul’s horizons, and its consequent activation on the divine plane of living, as the only truly good and more abundant life – that which is measured by the life of God. Accordingly, its primary foci of exploration are the immensity and diversity of the love of God.

### _Revealed Psychophysics_

 A Scriptural study of the great psychophysical laws governing the physical, mental, and moral balance of true Christian growth. This threefold development and integration of the personality is carefully viewed in its consummate embodiment in the man, Jesus. The ideal of the Christ poise and power is assiduously inculcated and pursued. Animated application is keynoted.

### _Revealed Sociology_

 An examination of the true social structure (the Edenic man, in his Edenic home in the Edenic school, in the Edenic state – the kingdom of the first dominion), the causes of its fall, and the conditions of its restoration. Most intensive study is devoted to the third phase of the course – to the social reforms involved in the regeneration, and in the transformation into the Kingdom of God, of the individual, the family, the school, and the church among those elements of society which elect to identify themselves with the divine purpose.

 -- {mctc 12}   
  
  ### _Revealed History_

 A survey of history from the divine point of view. Causes underlying the rise and fall of empires and nations from creation to the present are incisively traced. Types and cycles are especially noticed. Main attention is fixed on the agencies of the all-merciful Providence silently, patiently working out the counsels of His own will behind, above, and through all the vast play and counterplay of human interests and power and passions. Final focus is upon the climactic scene in the drama – the restoration of the Kingdom of God in the light of the great lessons brought to view.

### _Sacred Poetry and Song_

 An excavation into the poetic veins of revealed truth. The course includes a brief non-technical study of the form and the kinds of poetry in the Bible, while chief concern is with the spiritual esthetic of the sacred poems and songs.

### _Homiletics_

 A study of the art and science of effective composition and delivery of Scriptural discourses. Ministerial ideals are woven in throughout the course. The spiritual element is held aloft as the most important in all stages of the discourse. Varied opportunity is given for delivery.

 -- {mctc 13}   
  
  ### _Christian English_

 Remedial drill in the fundamentals of grammar, sentence and paragraph structure, punctuation, and oral and written composition. Constant emphasis is upon language study from the higher point of view, that it “be always with grace, seasoned with salt,” “the outward expression of an inward grace.”

### _The Student’s Pledge_

 As Christian students in American, devoted to God, and consequently loyal to the just principles of this free “government under God,” we pledge our hearts, our minds, our hands, our all, first to the

**[flag]**

of God’s eternal kingdom, and to the Theocracy for which it stands, one people made up of all nations, and bound by

 -- {mctc 14}   
  
  the cords of everlasting love, liberty, purity justice, peace, happiness, light and life for all, and second “to the

 [flag]

of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.”
